# Welcome to SortPerf!

SortPerf aims to help you choose your client side sorting algorithm based on your data and needs.
You can compare different size and type of arrays among most popular sorting algorithms.

You can also compare them with DogaSort which was developed and implemented by Doga Ozgon.
DogaSort is an easily customizable algorithm and by default it sorts and removes duplicates simultaneously.

The project is also deployed with github pages.
